      <h2>Types of Machines</h2>

      <h3>Simple Machines</h3>
      <p>Simple machines are basic mechanical devices that help make work easier by changing the direction or magnitude of a force. These include the lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, wedge, and screw.</p>
      <div class="image-visual"> <img src="images/pulley.jpg" alt="Pulley"> <img src="images/wheelandaxle.jpg" alt="Wheel and Axle"> </div>
      <p>Tools like wrenches, scissors, and hammers are modern examples that incorporate simple machine principles. For example, a wrench uses the wheel and axle concept to amplify rotational force.</p>
      <p>These machines have been used since ancient times ‚Äî think of Egyptian pyramids using ramps and levers!</p>
      <div class="image-visual"> <img src="images/pyramidconstruction.jpg" alt="Pyramid Construction"> </div>
      <p><em>Fun fact:</em> The six classical simple machines were first defined by Greek philosopher Archimedes over 2,000 years ago.</p>
      
      <h3>Steam-Powered Machines</h3>
      <p>Steam engines played a major role in the Industrial Revolution. They convert heat energy from boiling water into mechanical energy.</p>
      <p>The first practical steam engine was developed by Thomas Newcomen in the early 1700s, and later improved by James Watt. These engines powered trains, ships, and factory equipment.</p>
      <p>Steam-powered machines allowed industries to grow rapidly and made long-distance transportation much faster.</p>
      <p><em>Example:</em> Steam locomotives, paddle steamers, and early printing presses.</p>

      <h3>Electrical Machines</h3>
      <p>Electrical machines use electricity to generate motion, heat, light, or power. Unlike steam machines, they are cleaner, faster, and easier to control.</p>
      <p>Common types include electric motors (which convert electrical energy to mechanical energy), generators, and transformers.</p>
      <p>These machines power everything from household appliances to massive factory robots.</p>
      <p><em>Example:</em> Electric fans, microwave ovens, conveyor belts, and electric cars.</p>
