  <h2>Types of Machines</h2>

  <p>Machines can be classified based on their complexity, purpose, and how they operate. Below are some major types that have shaped human progress:</p>

  <h3>üîß Simple Machines</h3>
  <p>Simple machines are the building blocks of more complex devices. They help change the direction or amount of force, making work easier. There are six classical types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lever:</strong> Like a seesaw or crowbar ‚Äî multiplies force using a pivot point (fulcrum).</li>
    <li><strong>Pulley:</strong> A wheel and rope system that can lift heavy loads more easily.</li>
    <li><strong>Wheel and Axle:</strong> Reduces friction to move loads (e.g., carts, doorknobs).</li>
    <li><strong>Inclined Plane:</strong> A ramp-like surface to move objects upward with less force.</li>
    <li><strong>Wedge:</strong> A double inclined plane that splits or lifts objects (e.g., axe, knife).</li>
    <li><strong>Screw:</strong> An inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder (e.g., bolts, bottle caps).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Simple machines are everywhere: scissors combine levers and wedges, while a wheelbarrow uses levers and wheels to reduce effort.</p>

  <p><em>Fun fact:</em> Ancient Egyptians used ramps and levers to build the pyramids ‚Äî no engines, just simple machines!</p>

  <h3>üî• Steam-Powered Machines</h3>
  <p>Steam machines marked the beginning of the industrial era by using heat to create mechanical motion. These machines burn fuel to boil water, and the resulting steam powers pistons or turbines.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Steam Engines:</strong> Used in early trains and factories to drive mechanical processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Steamships:</strong> Revolutionized sea travel and trade.</li>
    <li><strong>Printing Presses:</strong> Steam-powered models dramatically sped up book production.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Inventors like <strong>Thomas Newcomen</strong> and <strong>James Watt</strong> played key roles in refining these technologies, boosting productivity during the Industrial Revolution.</p>

  <h3>‚ö° Electrical Machines</h3>
  <p>These machines convert electrical energy into mechanical, thermal, or light energy. They‚Äôre efficient, clean, and essential to modern living.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Electric Motors:</strong> Power household items like fans, washing machines, and electric cars.</li>
    <li><strong>Generators:</strong> Convert motion into electricity ‚Äî used in power plants.</li>
    <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> Regulate electricity flow, essential in the power grid.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whether it‚Äôs a robot arm on a car assembly line or a fan cooling your room, electrical machines are at the heart of today‚Äôs smart world.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em> Blenders, elevators, air conditioners, drones, and even electric toothbrushes.</p>
